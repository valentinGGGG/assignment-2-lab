Emerald was created for a close friend and collaborators single . I had somewhat of a vision when beginning this piece , as I knew I wanted to utilize the gemstones id just photographed at the museum of natual history in some way . The top graphic framed in the oval is actually a cluster of emeralds that have been warped and blurred enough to become somewhat unrecognizable . I drew inspiration from the concept of western retro futurism having a sort of bounty poster type of aesthetic , mixed with more hyper futuristic colors and visials . Utilizing framing , textures and blend modes helped finilaze my vision for this cover .
