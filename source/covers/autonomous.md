Autonomous originated as a photo taken by a fellow student of a close friend of mine . I was asked to do some touch ups for lighting/contrast , and ended up using the photo as a medium for experimenting in photoshop . Upon editing the photo more , a close friend and collaborator was piqued by the visuals and wanted to use it in some way for an ep cover . We ended up deciding on the name based on my inspiration from the cocept of a temporary autonomous zone , and i've since modified it more compared to the original design some years ago . This cover utilizes a mix of dithering and gradient map techniques .
