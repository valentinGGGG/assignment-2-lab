<div class="md-scale">
The Search Of Unity For All started off as a simple exploration of distortion effects within photoshop , leading to what you see now formed by improv ideas . This sort of cave looking formation preceded by a rippling lake was not my original concept , I wanted to have something a lot more minimalstic but through experimentation came inspiration and I enjoy that process a lot . The symbols used were all referenced by Henry Dreyfuss' symbol sourcebook , reading left to right "There exists the search of unity with god for all" So i decided to paraphrase that . This cover also hasnt been sent to anyone yet , but id like to use it soon .
