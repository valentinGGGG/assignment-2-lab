<div class="md-scale">
Purpose is everything started off conceptually as a nod to the album "pleasure is everything" , as my original photo gave a similar vibe to that albums cover . I wanted to explore abstracting and modifying a vast subject like this cityscape , in order to transform it into some sort of retrofuturistic spiritual message , as my obsession with the ankh was just beginning . I think the cover holds possibilities for worldbuilding , and im yet to send this to anyone so it will most likely be used for my personal projects . This piece utilizes long exposure , glow effects , texture stacking , and color grading techniques .
