This Poster strays from my other pieces hosted here , really only in its longer aspect ratio , but still pertains to my aesthetics ! This was asked of me for our spring 2025 core studio and lab "popup" event , which was just us displaying our final projects . I struggled balancing my time due to having other ideas for my final , but after hearing a poster could count I knew i wanted to . Despite this I worked fast to incorporate visuals from my actual final project as the background design utilizing symmetry , movement , and symbolism .
